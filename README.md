# Time-Task-Income-Analysis
This repository contains the raw data and code to produce clean versions of task, time, and income data performed and earned while at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

### Goals
To my knowledge, no government employee has ever documented their time in as much detail as I have made available in this repository. The goal was to continue to learn and practice Python and data analysis, but with a personal twist.

### Data
1. **Time Data**: Time data is from official timesheet records, submitted bi-weekly since I started on 7/14/2014.
2. **Task Data**: I recorded my tasks throughout the day. The task labels will require explanations, which I think I will work on developing in a data dictionary format and post as a reference document. Overtime my documentation techniques changed, as did the level of detail with which I recorded tasks.
