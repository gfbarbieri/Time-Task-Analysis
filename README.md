# Time-Task-Income-Analysis
Years of time-keeping while working at DOL.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a database my time entry/exit from the office, an expansive record of the tasks I performed while in the office, as well as my income every step of the way. To my knowledge, no government employee has ever documented their time in as much detail as is recorded in this repository.

### Data
1. Time Data: Time entry and exit time every day since I started on 7/14/2014 with the DOL.
2. Task Data: Every task I have recorded since I started recording my time. This record will itself require much explanation and will be done in a data dictionary format.
3. Training Data: All of the training I received while at the DOL, both employer- and self-funded.
4. Income Data (coming soon): My income every two weeks, that is, every single paycheck, as well as the amounts deducted and a description of the type of deduction. Includes bi-weekly employer contributions.
5. Leave Data (coming soon): Leave accured and used (sick, annual, credit, administrative, etc.).

### Personal Note
I diligently tracked information about myself because it (1) keeps me honest about my productivity, (2) managers need to know how long tasks take so that they can manage my time more effectively, and (3) I couldn't help it and have no idea why I get so much enjoyment out of it. Compiling all of these data sources was meant to be a continuation of my Python training, as this task required familiarity with multiple types of file types, database tables, and exploratory analysis techniques. One could accomplish the same experience using Kaggle datasets, but since I used time at work to train in Python, I might as well make it work-related and the results publicly accessible. As much as I enjoyed this project, I understand this may lead to more harm than good.
